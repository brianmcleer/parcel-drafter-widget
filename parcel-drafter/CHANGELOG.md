# Changelog

Newest first.

## 1.8.4 (2026-09-18)

- Settings: a **Show help guide** option. Turn it off and the question-mark button and the first-run hint both disappear; the guide itself is untouched. Undefined means on, so apps configured before this release keep their help button.

## 1.8.3 (2026-09-18)

- Security: the beacon's session id now falls back to `crypto.getRandomValues` and then to a clock value instead of `Math.random`, which CodeQL flags as insecure randomness (shared beacon 1.1.1). The id only groups one page load's events; it is never a secret or a credential.
- Build: `tsconfig.json` is `jsx: react-jsx` with `jsxImportSource: @emotion/react`, matching the Experience Builder client. ts-loader reads the widget tsconfig, and the previous classic `jsx: react` setting made the settings panel and runtime fail with "Cannot convert undefined or null to object" after a full rebuild. No functional change.

## 1.8.2 (2026-09-18)

- Added: anonymous usage and error telemetry (shared beacon module; off unless the portal publishes an exb-beacon-sink table; telemetry: false in config disables it).
