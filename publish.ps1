  publish.ps1  -  One-command publish/update for an ExB custom widget repo.
  1. Copies the latest widget from the EB folder into this repo's widget subfolder
     (skips node_modules, .vs, and any working folders listed in $ExcludeDirs,
     such as "Claude outputs").
  2. Removes those excluded folders from the repo subfolder if an earlier run or a
     hand copy left them there, so they never reach GitHub or the release zip.
  3. Auto-runs 'git init' on first use if the folder is not a git repo yet.
  4. Commits.
  5. Publishes the repo to GitHub on first run, or pushes updates after.
  6. (Optional) Cuts a versioned GitHub Release with a downloadable zip.

  RUN (from a terminal opened in this repo folder):
    Normal update:            powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\publish.ps1
    Update + release v1.1.0:  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\publish.ps1 -Release v1.1.0
    With a commit message:    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\publish.ps1 -Release v1.1.0 -CommitMessage "Subject`n`nBody"

  REDO A RELEASE (the tag must not already exist on GitHub):
    gh release delete v1.1.0 --cleanup-tag --yes
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\publish.ps1 -Release v1.1.0 -CommitMessage "..."
